- [(CFLP)](https://github.com/TheEric960/logistics-models/tree/main/CFLP) Capacitated Fixed-Charge Location Problem
- [(MCLP)](https://github.com/TheEric960/logistics-models/tree/main/MCLP) Maximum Covering Location Problem
- [(SCLP)](https://github.com/TheEric960/logistics-models/tree/main/SCLP) Set-Covering Location Models
- [(UFLP)](https://github.com/TheEric960/logistics-models/tree/main/UFLP) Uncapacitated Fixed-Charge Location Problem
- [(NDP)](https://github.com/TheEric960/logistics-models/tree/main/NDP) Node Design Problem
- [(pCP)](https://github.com/TheEric960/logistics-models/tree/main/pCP) p-Center Problem
- [(pMP)](https://github.com/TheEric960/logistics-models/tree/main/pMP) p-Median Problem

Notes
- The `.ipynb` files render differently in GitHub. This may result in latex formulas looking slightly off.
- Note that GitHub does not support `README.ipynb` files at the moment. For them to render more properly, navigate to the file.
